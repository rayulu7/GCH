                Housing Socieities' maintenance associations can significantly reduce the fixed expenditure and also avail power at a fixed cost for atleast 25 years by switching over to rooftop solar power system, and at the same time they can get environment friendly power. Associations have to incur heavy monthly expenditure to maintain the power needs of common areas like lifts, corridors, water supply, lighting etc. Not only they are charged as per commercial rates, they are also subject to periodical upward revision.
