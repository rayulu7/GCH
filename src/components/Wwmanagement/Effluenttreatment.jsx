              Effluent treatment plants (ETP) are playing a crucial role in
              protecting the environment by purifying the industrial wastewater.
              Generally the Industrial wastewater consists of a higher
              concentration of hazardous chemicals, heavy metals and a few other
              pollutants which are harmful if they are released directly into
              the environment without treating or purifying.
